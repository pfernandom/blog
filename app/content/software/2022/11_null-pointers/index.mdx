Every student who writes their first lines of code is being told a very simple, yet loaded, request:

> "Always validate your input".
> _Almost any coding teacher._

Even in job interviews, developers are expected to do something like follows:

```java
public void doSomething(String input) {
    // check input is not null
    if (input != null) {
        // now you can use input
    }

    // handle the bad input: Throw an exception,
    // return a default value, log an error or just do nothing.
}
```

If we don't just take the word of our teachers and try to do what we're not supposed to do (which in my opinion is how one tends to learn things the _hard but effective_ way), we would find ourselves in the following situation with some Java code:

```java
public int doSomething(String input) {
    return input.length();
}

String badInput = null;
doSomething(badInput); // <- Exception in thread "main"
                       //    java.lang.NullPointerException
```

We can find the same scenario in JavaScript:

```js
function doSomething(input) {
  return input.length
}
doSomething(null) // <- Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read
//      properties of null (reading 'length')
```

Any programming language with `null` in its specification can find similar problems.

And so, it becomes second nature to add these validations to functions. It also becomes a burden.

As their applications grew, developers began to write code like the following:

```js
function doSomething(input) {
  if (input != null) {
    return doSomethingElse(input)
  }
}

function doSomethingElse(input) {
  if (input != null) {
    return input.length
  }
}
```

This repetitive pattern led to some critical thinking:

_"Well, I only need to validate the input in the first function `doSomething`. Once execution reaches `doSomethingElse`, we know for sure the input is valid_.

This thought is correct, assuming `doSomething` will _always_ validate its input. This decision simplifies our code, while keeping its correctness, and becomes particularly useful as the complexity of the application grows:

```js
function doSomething(input) {
  if (input != null) {
    return doSomethingElse(input)
  }
}

function doSomethingElse(input) {
  return doSomeOtherThing(input)
}

function doSomeOtherThing(input) {
  // input is still valid!
}
```

## Simple patterns not always address complexity

While this pattern works, there is a big problem: Software developers are human. We get tired of repetitive tasks; we miss things and make mistakes. It's easy to fail to validate input, especially when it's complex.

What if `input` is a complex object with hundreds of nested attributes?

Imagine `input` is data structure we filled with all the records in a database table:

```json
{
  "products": {
    "metadata": {
      "id": "somelongandalphanumericid"
      //..
    },
    // 10435 elements:
    "elements": [
      {
        "product1": {
          "name": "My Movie!"
          //...
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

We can try to adapt our `input != null` pattern and extend it:

- Validate using loops
- Create utility functions to validate object attributes
- Recursively validate object attributes

Now, a validation as simple as checking if a variable is `null` or not becomes a complex problem that requires analytical thinking and carefully designed algorithms.

Of course, we could try to make things right and advance our validations even further: Don't store `null` values.

_"Of course!"_, you might think. If we never store any `null` value in our database, we don't need to add validations to the functions that will read them.

However, this is a faulty idea. There are a couple of problems with it.

First, some values are _optional_. For instance, addresses in the United States often include "County" as one of their fields. However, other countries may not have analogs to "County". Even within the United States, states don't use "Counties"; for instance, Louisiana is partitioned into "parishes".

People may not have a middle name, they may not have phone numbers. There will _always_ be attributes without a value.

_"Well"_, you may say now, _"let's make them 'empty'"_. If a person has no middle name, then just store an empty string.

This not only doesn't fix the issue, as you would still have to validate variables for `null` values (more on this later), but now you also have to find a way to differentiate from _invalid_ empty values and _valid_ values that also happen to be empty.

Replacing `null` for `""` or `0` doesn't work because...

**null is just a flag**.

In C++, `NULL` is special value with a _float_ value -which, depending on the compiler, is often `0`-. Assigning `NULL` to a pointer variable is no different than assigning `0` to it.

From a semantic point of view, `null` is nothing else than a value used to indicate a lack of value.

There are many resources online that explain the historic meaning of `null`, why it was introduced and why `NULL` takes specific values like ` 0x00000000`, `0xFFFFFFFF` or `0xDEADBEEF` in languages like C. It is not my intention on dwelling on these matters, but these articles are a good reading to understand the background behind this special value.

The second problem with validating input "only when it enters our program" is that...

## Input _lies_

Even if we sanitize every input entering our application, `null` values have a way to sneak into our application.

Let's look at a deceiving -and a bit contrived- Java example:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class RolesManager {

  private String user;

  private void setUserRole(int id) {
    if (id == 0) {
      this.user = "admin";
    } else if (id == 100) {
      this.user = "user";
    }
  }

  private String getUserRole() {
    return this.user;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    RolesManager roleManager = new RolesManager();
    roleManager.setUserRole(2);

    Map<String, String> roles = new HashMap<>();
    roles.put("user1", roleManager.getUserRole());

    // do more stuff

    System.out.println(roles.getOrDefault("user1", "anonymous"));
  }
}


```

The function `setUserRole` is expected to fill `RolesManager`'s `role` variable, which then is retrieved with `getUserRole`, and added to the `roles` map under the `user1` key.

When we want to retrieve the role from the map, we want to be extra careful about it and use `getOrDefault`, expecting that, even if the key `user1` doesn't exist in `roles`, we will always receive the non-`null` value `anonymous`. Good enough, right?

Well, here, `roles.getOrDefault("user1", "anonymous")` will return `null` because `this.role` is never initialized. The code compiles, so we don't see this error until we execute our application.

The `getOrDefault` method did little to protect us from the `null` value because `user1` _does_ exist in the map (so `getOrDefault` will return its assigned value) but the actual value in the map for that key is `null`.

But the data that _lies_ the most is the data we receive from _outside_ our application: Data received from external APIs, databases, and other services, whether we own them or not. These resources will often assure you that it contains no `null` values, but once they have _internal errors_, they may return unexpected data, which in turn may lead to `null` attributes.

In the JavaScript world is especially common to get `null` values
