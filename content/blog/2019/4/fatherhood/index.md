Having a baby is daunting. 

## Personal Time Off

Taking time out of work is a [polarizing topic](https://bit.ly/2I5cCUj) for Silicon Valley: Either you should at least be [working 25 hours a day](https://cnb.cx/2JZcnfW) to be a successful entrepreneur, [working while your competition sleeps](https://bit.ly/2CMNApu), and spending your weekends building side projects; or you should completely disconnect from Internet, never writing a single line of code outside of work hours.

For a while, I was convinced that you could get a balanced schedule. A year ago, it wasn't difficult to find time to code while also finding a moment to play video games with my older son, or taking my wife out for dinner.  
That changed when the new baby arrived.

I'm very thankful of working at LinkedIn, where you get a lot of time for paternity leave; a benefit [unavailable to more than 30 million workers in the USA](https://bit.ly/2FQtqNa) and that people who do have it don't tend to fully appreciate it.

During my weeks off, I was horrified of going back to work and being so rusty that I would be left behind in my project. In between diaper changes, I felt the urge of writing code, or just looking at Stack to see what was happening back at the office.

Thankfully, with my wife's help (and a good dose of self-control and many, many nights without sleeping), I fully disconnected and used my time to take care of my family.  
And while I wasn't sure at the time, looking back not only I don't regret that decision but I'm more convinced today that I shouldn't have worried about work.

One thing needs to be clear: As valuable as the time you spend coding is, you can always do it later. Feeding your newborn baby is something that, if it goes away, it will never come back.

## New time schedule

After weeks of not knowing when I would be able to sleep through a whole night again (*spoiler alert: not soon enough*) the time I used to have for any personal activities got reduced to minutes in a week.

The first thing to go was the time I dedicated to my weekend projects and blog writing. I chose things like playing a video game once in a while, or watching a movie over the *side hustle* for a very simple reason: Avoiding burnout.

  *Not that kind of burnout*
</p>
Even when it's my own personal code, it's still code. And while I love to write code every day, my brain needed a break once in a while.

As time passes, I learn to better manage my time and I start to do more things, like writing this blog.  

After so much people told me that I wouldn't be *marketable* in the software world without side projects, it was just relaxing seeing that nothing wrong happened when I chose to give priority to my family and my day work for almost a year.

It was ok to drop out coding for a while. If you like it as much as you think you do, retaking it will be easy.
