The browser will render the <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;h1&gt;</code> element and as more chunks are streamed, more parts of the page will be rendered.\nIn this way, we can get content to the user as fast as possible, without having to wait for those costly operations to finish before even sending the first byte of response.</p>\n<h3>Scripts and stylesheets</h3>\n<p>Using the same chunking technique, we can return JS and CSS files:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">app.get(&#39;/styles.css&#39;, function (req, res) {\n  res.write(&#39;h1 { background-color:blue; }&#39;);\n  res.write(&#39;.my-text { background-color:yellow; }&#39;);\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    res.write(&quot; body { background-color: grey; }&quot;);\n    res.end();\n  }, 4000);\n});\n\napp.get(&#39;/script.js&#39;, function (req, res) {\n  res.write(&#39;console.log(&quot;hello&quot;);&#39;);\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    res.write(&#39;console.log(&quot;world&quot;);&#39;);\n    res.end();\n  }, 4000);\n});</code></pre></div>\n<p>Unlike the chunked HTML, the browser will not execute/render each chunk as it gets it. It has to wait for the whole file to finish loading before it can continuing rendering the HTML which is declared after these <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;script&gt;</code> tags. So, even if we stream these resources, they will still block rendering.\nFor example, once the browser gets to the <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag for the <code class=\"language-text\">script.js</code> file we defined above, both <code class=\"language-text\">hello</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">world</code> will be printed in console at the same time, after the 4 seconds delay.</p>\n<p>Why is the browser not processing these files as they get streamed? This is out of the scope of this text, but from a high point of view is because <strong>the browser cannot correctly calculate styles or execute scripts without knowing the whole content of the file</strong>.\nTake as an example a JavaScript file. Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_hoisting.asp\">hoisting</a>, declarations of JavaScript functions can be bellow their invocations:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">main();\n\nfunction main(){\n  console.log(&#39;Go main!&#39;);\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>So, even if the browser browser is able to read the first line with <code class=\"language-text\">main()</code>, how would it know what to execute if it doesn’t have the function declaration yet?.</p>\n<h3>Fixing blocking resources</h3>\n<p>There are multiple ways to remove blocking CSS and JS, like inlining critical CSS and JS. It won’t change the blocking behavior of the <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;link&gt;</code> tags, but it will reduce the overhead of extra network requests and (hopefully) it will be smaller in content than the full, non-critical resources.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/BlockingJS\">https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/BlockingJS</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Demo</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/54c282e15daa4dcc94ef0eb9821ef2fb/demo.gif\" alt=\"Gif showing the server running\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Streaming HTML responses","date":"June 21, 2019","description":"How does HTML chunking work when streaming HTML files to the browser?"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019/6/html-chunking/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019/4/fatherhood/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fatherhood in Silicon Valley"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019/7/array-fill/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Weird behavior for matrix created with Array.fill()"}}}}}
