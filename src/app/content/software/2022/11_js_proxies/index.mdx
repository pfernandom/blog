JavaScript is an extremely flexible language. Sometimes _too_ flexible.

The built-in classes and objects like `Array`, `Map`, `window` and `document` can be modified and extended: We can add properties and functions and even override the existing ones. Take arrays, for instance. We can add new methods to them:

```js
const list = []
list.doSomething = function () {
  console.log('Something')
}
list.doSomething()

// output: "Something"
```

We can also override and modify existing methods, like `Array.prototype.push`:

```js
const list = []
const old = list.push
list.push = function () {
  console.log('Something')
}
list.push(3)
// output: "Something"
```

But, as this example illustrates, this flexibility comes with a risk: If we're not careful, we can break the correct behavior of these classes. In the example above, the `push` method for the variable `list` will stop working as expected (e.g. appending elements to the array).

There is an even more dangerous approach to this override:

```js
Array.prototype.push = function () {
  console.log('Something')
}

const list = []
list.push(3)
// output: "Something", and the list is empty!
```
