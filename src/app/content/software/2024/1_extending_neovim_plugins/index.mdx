Neovim's customization features are powerful. Just drop a Lua file in the right place and you get a new extension, a new set of keymaps, or new coding language capabilities.

What separates Neovim's extensibility and plugin customization from other IDEs like VSCode is capability of doing big changes to your editor using only a couple of lines of a very simple scripting language (Lua).

There are [tons of tutorials](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide) out there of how to create new custom Neovim plugins; and my intention is not to create one more. For this blog post, I want to share with you a very specific type of customization: **Using an existing plugin to extend its capabilities**.

## A working example: The extending the [Obisdian Neovim plugin](https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim)
