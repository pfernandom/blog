I was using JavaScript for completing some Leetcode challenges and I got some pretty weird behavior.

I tried to create a matrix (a two-dimension array, or array of arrays), initialize it with `false` and then use it in some backtracking problem. I did something like this:

```javascript
// Initialize a 3x4 matrix with "false" values.
const matrix = Array(3).fill(Array(4).fill(false))

// some stringify to capture the actual values at this point of the execution
console.log(JSON.stringify(matrix))

// set middle value to true
matrix[1][1] = true

console.log(JSON.stringify(matrix))
```

And my console prints this:

```javascript
;[
  [false, false, false, false],
  [false, false, false, false],
  [false, false, false, false],
][
  ([false, true, false, false],
  [false, true, false, false],
  [false, true, false, false])
]
```

Wait, what? If I only set the value at 1,1 to **true**, why am I getting changed values in the whole column?

Well, this is because the parameter passed to `Array.fill()` is not really a callback. It only gets evaluated once, and its used for filling all the elements in the array.

So, in this case, we have only two arrays. The array `A` (`Array(3)`), which has 3 elements, and array `B` (`Array(4)`) which has 4 elements.

`Array(4)` creates array `B`, and `B` is passed as parameter to the `Array(3).fill(B)`.

To be clearer, this is what we are actually doing, broken into more steps:

```javascript
const B = Array(4).fill(false)
const A = Array(3).fill(B)
const matrix = A
```

As we can see, we're filling `A` with the same reference of `B`, three times. Any changes to `B` will be reflected in each element of `A`.

## How do we fix it?

Try this instead:

```javascript
const matrix = Array(3)
  .fill()
  .map((el) => Array(4).fill(false))
```

This will create array `A`, and then use the `map` function to call `Array(4).fill(false)` once per each element of `A`, generating new arrays for each one.

Looking back at why the problem happened, it seems pretty obvious. However, when I was puzzled when it first happened, and I couldn't find any example of anyone else doing the same.

Hope this helps other people.
