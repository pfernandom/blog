Hosting your own blog is the kind of thing that every software developer wants to do. It's usually cheaper, you have control over your data, and you have the option to monetize it.

Whether you're a web developer or not, writing HTML can be cumbersome if you want to post fairly often. Most of the time you will want to focus on the content of your post, not on the code quality of the web page you're building to host it.

Here, Markdown is a great tool to speed up your blog posting capabilities.

## Markdown

Markdown defines a set of rules that indicate what kind of formatting text should have. The following are some of the most basic rules:

<table className="post-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Element</td>
      <td>Markdown Syntax</td>
      <td>Example</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Heading</td>
      <td>
        <div># H1</div>
        <div>## H2</div>
        <div>### H3</div>
      </td>
      <td>
        <div
          style={{ fontSize: '2em', fontWeight: '500', marginBottom: '0.25em' }}
        >
          {'H1'}
        </div>
        <div
          style={{
            fontSize: '1.5em',
            fontWeight: '500',
            marginBottom: '0.25em',
          }}
        >
          {'H2'}
        </div>
        <div
          style={{ fontSize: '1em', fontWeight: '500', marginBottom: '0.25em' }}
        >
          {'H3'}
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bold</td>
      <td>\**bold text**</td>
      <td>**bold text**</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Italic</td>
      <td>\*italicized text*</td>
      <td>*italicized text*</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Blockquote</td> <td>\> blockquote</td>
      <td>*(Adds a quote container)*</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ordered List</td>
      <td>
        <div>1. First item</div>
        <div>2. Second item</div>
        <div>3. Third item</div>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>First item</li>
          <li>Second item</li>
          <li>Third item</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Unordered List</td>
      <td>
        <div>- First item</div>
        <div>- Second item</div>
        <div>- Third item</div>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>First item</li>
          <li>Second item</li>
          <li>Third item</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Code</td>
      <td> \`code\`</td>
      <td> `code` </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Horizontal Rule</td>
      <td> \---</td>
      <td>
        <hr />
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Link</td>
      <td style={{ width: '217px' }}>\[title](https://www.example.com)</td>
      <td>[title](https://www.example.com)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Image</td>
      <td> \!\[alt text](image.jpg)</td>
      <td>*(displays `image.jpg`)*</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Markdown makes it easy to write formatted text. For instance, the following snippet of Markdown:

```markdown
# Welcome to my blog!

Start with the [first article](/blog/2022/9/markdown-to-html)
```

Gets formatted like follows:

---

<div style={{ fontSize: '2em', fontWeight: '500', marginBottom: '0.25em' }}>
  {'Welcome to my blog!'}
</div>

Start with the [first article](/blog/2022/9/markdown-to-html)

---

Many tools exist to build blogs from Markdown. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a popular choice to build static websites out of Markdown.

However, when you are writing a technical blog, you will start noticing the limitations of working with out-of-the-box solutions. The point I hit these limits was with **code formatting**.

### Limitation: Code formatting

Markdown has two ways of highlighting code. The block element:

````markdown
```
public class App {
  public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
}
```
````

And the inline element

```
`System.out.println("Hello")`
```

[PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/) and [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) are two JavaScript libraries to highlight code keywords for multiple programming languages.

With PrismJS, setting a language for formatting is as easy as introducing the library (along with the CSS for a given theme) and then adding the language name to the code block declaration. For the example above, we get the following result:

````
```java
public class App {
  public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
}
```
````

```java
public class App {
  public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
}
```

But, what happens with the inline code? Markdown rules won't allow us to do something like

```
`System.out.println("Hello")`java
```

If we wanted to add custom CSS classes to Markdown-generated components, we find that Markdown doesn't specify the syntax to do so. Tools like Jekyll do allow for use of HTML elements inside Markdown, but it starts defeating a bit the purpose of using Markdown to speed-up writing.

If we want to extend Markdown syntax, we must modify the way Markdown is converted to HTML.

## Getting our hands dirty: Introducing Unified

[Unified](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified) is a framework to process Markdown. It's a plugin-based tool that allows you to inspect and modify the way Markdown is converted to other formats like HTML.

Its general structure looks like this:

```js
import { unified } from 'unified'

const result = await unified()
  .use(...) // add a plug-in
  .process(await read('./example.md'))
```

Unified relies on two toolsets **remark** and **rehype**:

- [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark): "remark is a tool that transforms markdown with plugins. These plugins can inspect and change your markup. You can use remark on the server, the client, CLIs, deno, etc."
- [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype): "rehype is a tool that transforms HTML with plugins. These plugins can inspect and change the HTML. You can use rehype on the server, the client, CLIs, deno, etc."

With a combination of plugins from these two toolsets, we can fully customize the way we parse Markdown into HTML.

Some common plugins are:

- [remark-parse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-parse): remark plugin to add support for parsing markdown input.
- [remark-rehype](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype): remark plugin that turns markdown into HTML to support rehype.
- [rehype-document](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-document): rehype plugin to wrap a fragment in a document.
- [rehype-format](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-format): rehype plugin to format (pretty-print) an HTML document.
- [rehype-stringify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-stringify): rehype plugin to add support for serializing HTML (to string).

Putting all these plugins together, the example looks like this:

```js
import { unified } from 'unified'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import rehypeDocument from 'rehype-document'
import rehypeFormat from 'rehype-format'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import { read } from 'to-vfile'

const result = await unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(rehypeDocument)
  .use(rehypeFormat)
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process(await read('./test/example.md'))
```

Where `result` is a `VFile` -a virtual representation of the HTML file- that can be easily saved as an HTML file.

### Analyzing the transformation process

The following image represents the process the Markdown file follows to become HTML:

<Image src={process} alt="Transformation process of Markdown to HTML" />

The following is a step-by-step description of the process:

1. The Markdown file contents are read and placed into a `VFile`.
2. `remark` parses and process the Markdown text, and converts it into an [abstract syntax tree (AST)](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#syntax-tree). This tree is composed of [unist](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist) nodes, which follow the [Markdown Abstract Syntax Tree (mdast)](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast) structure.
3. `remark-rehype` translates the `mdast` structure into a [Hypertext Abstract Syntax Tree (hast)](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast) structure, also composed of `unist` nodes.
4. `rehype` process and transforms the `hast` structure into HTML.

Unified allows us to build plugins and process both the `mdast` and `hast` structures.

## mdast and hast

Before we try to customize the transformation process, let us look at how `mdast` and `hast` are represented.

In `mdast`, each node represents an abstract element. For instance, the _paragraph_ or `p` element is represented as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "paragraph",
  "children": [{ "type": "text", "value": "Alpha bravo charlie." }]
}
```

That same node has the following representation in `hast` as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "element",
  "tagName": "p",
  "properties": {},
  "children": [{ "type": "text", "value": "Alpha bravo charlie." }]
}
```

Notice that `mdast` has a different level of abstraction than `hast`: `hast` represents HTML elements, where "paragraph" is defined with the tag name `p`.

We can look at the same difference for `code`. The following markdown...

````
```
foo()
```
````

...becomes the following `mdast`:

```json
{
  "type": "code",
  "lang": null,
  "meta": null,
  "value": "foo()"
}
```

...and the following `hast`:

```json
{
  "type": "element",
  "tagName": "pre",
  "properties": {},
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "element",
      "tagName": "code",
      "properties": {},
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "value": "foo()\n"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

And the inline version \`bar()\` becomes the `mdast`:

```json
{
  "type": "inlineCode",
  "value": "bar()"
}
```

...and the `hast`:

```json
{
  "type": "element",
  "tagName": "code",
  "properties": {},
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "value": "bar()"
    }
  ]
}
```

Notice that the block version of `code` wraps the `<code/>` HTML element in `<pre/>`, to preserve alignment and whitespaces. The inline version, however, just creates a `<code/>` element.

The block version allows us to add a value to the `lang` property. The following Mardown:

````
```js
foo();
```
````

...gets parsed as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "code",
  "lang": "js",
  "meta": null,
  "value": "foo();"
}
```

and:

```json
{
  "type": "element",
  "tagName": "pre",
  "properties": {},
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "element",
      "tagName": "code",
      "properties": {
        "className": ["language-js"]
      },
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "value": "foo();\n"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The Markdown parser follows the [HTML5 specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-code-element) for `<code/>` to define the language used in that block: Using the `lang` attribute with a value of `language-[LANG]`.

As we can see, we can use CSS to find `<code/>` blocks with class names for a given language (e.g. `language-js`) and process them accordingly.

In fact, PrismJS looks for `<code class="language-[LANG]></code/>` blocks to tokenize the text content and highlight keywords.

While the HTML5 specification allows for the use of `lang` in `<code/>` elements _not_ wrapped in `<pre/>` elements, there is no defined way in the Markdown syntax to set that attribute.

### Adding "lang" to inline code

We will extend the Rehype process to interpret inline code blocks like follows:

```md
`highlighted^const inline = "code";`
```

We will split the contents of the code block in two: Text before a separator `^` and the text after that:

```js
const [part1, part2] = ['markdown', 'const inline = "code";']
```

Then, we will use the first part as the `code`'s class name, and the second part as its contents.

The following code snippet is an extract of the Rehype plugin [rehype-inline-code-classname](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-inline-code-classname) I published to NPM to allow setting a class name to inline code blocks:

```typescript
import { Element, Root, Text } from 'hast'
import { Transformer } from 'unified'
import { visit } from 'unist-util-visit'

export function rehypeInlineCodeClassNamePlugin(
  options?: Options
): void | Transformer<Root, Root> {
  const separator = options?.separator ?? '^'
  const trailing = options?.trailing ?? false

  return function (root) {
    function extract(value: String) {
      const [_, part1, part2] =
        value.match(new RegExp(`(.+)\\${separator}(.+)`)) ?? []

      return trailing
        ? { className: part2, content: part1 }
        : { className: part1, content: part2 }
    }

    visit(
      root,
      'element',
      function visitor(node: Element, i: number | null, parent: any) {
        if (node.tagName !== 'code') return
        if (!parent || parent.tagName === 'pre') return

        const [{ value, ...rest }] = node.children as Text[]
        if (value.includes(separator) && value.length > 2) {
          const { className, content } = extract(value)
          node.children = [{ value: content, ...rest }] as Text[]
          node.properties = {
            className: className,
          }
        }
      }
    )

    return root
  }
}
export type Options =
  | {
      separator: string
      trailing: boolean
    }
  | void
  | undefined
```

#### Working with AST: _visit_

In this plugin, we use the function `visit` from [unist-util-visit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unist-util-visit) to navigate the `hast` tree and find all nodes:

```typescript
visit(root, 'element',
      function visitor(node: Element, i: number | null, parent: any) {
        //..
      }
```

Notice that `visit` receives three parameters:

- The root node of the `hast`.
- The type of node we want to visit. In our example, it will iterate through all nodes of type `element`.
- A function that will receive references to the `node`, and index `i` and the node's `parent`.

From here, we can modify the `hast` in any way we need to: Remove, add or update nodes.

#### Processing all "code" elements

We filter out all the nodes that don't have a `tagName` of `code`, and all `tagName:code` nodes that have a `tagName:pre` node as a parent, as those are block-type code elements:

```typescript
if (node.tagName !== 'code') return
if (!parent || parent.tagName === 'pre') return
```

We get the node's `value` attribute and check if it contains the expected separator `markdown^^` (and the code element actually has enough characters for having left and right substrings):

```typescript
const [{ value, ...rest }] = node.children as Text[]
if (value.includes(separator) && value.length > 2) {
  //...
}
```

If the value can be parsed with the separator, then we extract both substrings using a `RegExp`:

```typescript
const [_, part1, part2] =
  value.match(new RegExp(`(.+)\\${separator}(.+)`)) ?? []
```

The plugin allows a configuration object to define a custom separator and whether we want to set the class name at the end of the block like follows:

```markdown
`const inline = "code";^highlighted`
```

Depending on the configuration, we set `className` and `content` with `part1` and `part2`; then we update the `hast` node as follows:

```typescript
const { className, content } = extract(value)
node.children = [{ value: content, ...rest }] as Text[]
node.properties = {
  className: className,
}
```

We reset the node's `children` attribute with the actual content of the code block, and we set the `className` property to the substring we extracted using the separator.

### Using the plugin

To include our plugin, we just need to add it to the chain of plugins after `remark-rehype`, as we're working with a `hast`:

```js
import { myRehypePlugin } from '../src/plugin/index.ts'

const result = await unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(myRehypePlugin) // our rehype plugin
  .use(rehypeDocument)
  .use(rehypeFormat)
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process(await read('./test/example.md'))
```

We now can set any class name we need for inline code blocks:

```markdown
`language-java^foo()`
```

will become:

```html
<code class="markdown">^</code>
```

### Revisiting code formatting

Since we now can set class names to our inline code blocks, we can use CSS and JavaScript to further format and style these elements:

```css
code[class*='language-'] {
  background-color: #f2f5ff;
  padding: 0.1em;
  border-radius: 0.3em;
  white-space: normal;
}
```

Unfortunately, the changes we have done are not enough to operate with plugins like [rehype-prism](https://github.com/mapbox/rehype-prism), as those assume `<code/>` blocks are wrapped by `<pre/>` elements. To highlight keywords in our code, we must use a tool to tokenize and highlight keywords, which is exactly what `PrismJS` does.

In a future blog entry, we will extend this example to use [refractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/refractor?activeTab=readme) to create a custom `rehype` plugin which extends `rehype-prism`'s capabilities, and allows us to highlight keywords in inline code blocks.

### Conclusion

Unified offers an ecosystem of plugins that allow us to extend and customize the way Markdown is converted to HTML.

Creating a `rehype` or `remark` plugin requires us to handle abstract syntax trees, but `unist` tools like `unist-util-visit` offer helper functions that reduce the level of complexity of these tasks.

Frameworks like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown) integrate nicely with Unified/remark plugins, allowing to convert Markdown files to HTML which can be easily rendered in the application. They even offer integration with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a superset of Markdown that allows the use of React components _inside_ Markdown files.

However, Unified can be used to generate static HTML pages directly, allowing us to keep updated our self-hosted blogs.

#### On hosting

Free hosting for self-managed blogs exist out there. A good example is [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which integrates pretty nicely with tools like Jekyll. But we can just use HTML files created through Unified.
