Hosting your own blog is the kind of thing that every software developer wants to do. It's usually cheaper, you have control over your data, and you have the option to monetize it.

Whether you're a web developer or not, writing HTML can be cumbersome if you want to post fairly often. Most of the time you will want to focus on the content of your post, not in the code quality of the web page you're building to host it.

Here, Markdown is a great tool to speed up your blog posting capabilities.

## Markdown
