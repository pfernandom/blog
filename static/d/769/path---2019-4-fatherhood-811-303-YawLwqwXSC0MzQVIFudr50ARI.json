A few months ago I tried to consistently write at <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pfernandom/latest\">Medium</a>, where some of my articles got a pretty good response.</p>\n<p>However, I felt that being a Software Engineer and not writing my own blog was ironic, at least. And while I didn’t code it from the ground up (thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\">Gatsby</a>), I have more control over it.</p>\n<p>So, for my first post, I decided to share a bit about the reason why I haven’t been writing lately: the weirdness of being a father of two kids with very different ages, here at the Bay Area.</p>\n<h2>Personal Time Off</h2>\n<p>Taking time out of work is a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2I5cCUj\">polarizing topic</a> for Silicon Valley: Either you should at least be <a href=\"https://cnb.cx/2JZcnfW\">working 25 hours a day</a> to be a successful entrepreneur, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2CMNApu\">working while your competition sleeps</a>, and spending your weekends building side projects; or you should completely disconnect from Internet, never writing a single line of code outside of work hours.</p>\n<p>For a while, I was convinced that you could get a balanced schedule. A year ago, it wasn’t difficult to find time to code while also finding a moment to play video games with my older son, or taking my wife out for dinner.<br>\nThat changed when the new baby arrived.</p>\n<p>I’m very thankful of working at LinkedIn, where you get a lot of time for paternity leave; a benefit <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2FQtqNa\">unavailable to more than 30 million workers in the USA</a> and that people who do have it don’t tend to fully appreciate it.</p>\n<p>During my weeks off, I was horrified of going back to work and being so rusty that I would be left behind in my project. In between diaper changes, I felt the urge of writing code, or just looking at Stack to see what was happening back at the office.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/49286/baby.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQF/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQD/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAcl9ecQQb//EABoQAQEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBAAMREiH/2gAIAQEAAQUCXt6LlGm5NqxWxf/EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREv/aAAgBAwEBPwGtP//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS/9oACAECAQE/AUv/xAAWEAEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEQH/2gAIAQEABj8CwhD/xAAbEAEAAwADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUFhcf/aAAgBAQABPyHcPkEIF32cTQhlsPSbPY41n//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQPD//xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQD/2gAIAQMBAT8QUVxRd//EABgRAQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESEx/9oACAECAQE/EAHVgdb/xAAaEAEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUGR/9oACAEBAAE/EMhl5VtQ52kS/UYJB0ZV3cqhJAoX7AEzN7n/2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Depicted: A baby, but not mine\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/c739e/baby.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/8ee9c/baby.jpg 148w,\n/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/ebbe7/baby.jpg 295w,\n/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/c739e/baby.jpg 590w,\n/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/5413e/baby.jpg 885w,\n/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/4efde/baby.jpg 1180w,\n/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/abfc3/baby.jpg 1770w,\n/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/49286/baby.jpg 5472w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    \n<em>image_caption</em></p>\n<p>Thankfully, with my wife’s help and a good dose of self-control, I fully disconnected and used my time to take care of my family. And while I wasn’t sure at the time, looking back not only I don’t regret that decision but I’m more convinced today that I shouldn’t have worried about work.</p>\n<p>One thing needs to be clear: You can always read an email a few weeks later;but you won’t get the chance of feeding your newborn baby again (unless you have another kid, but for that matter you can also get another job with more emails attached to it, don’t you?).</p>\n<h2>New time schedule</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fatherhood in Silicon Valley","date":"April 01, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019/4/fatherhood/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World"}},"next":null}}
