A few months ago I tried to consistently write at <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pfernandom/latest\">Medium</a>, where some of my articles got a pretty good response.</p>\n<p>However, I felt that being a Software Engineer and not writing my own blog was ironic, at least. And while I didn’t code it from the ground up (thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\">Gatsby</a>), I have more control over it.</p>\n<p>So, for my first post, I decided to share a bit about the reason why I haven’t been writing lately: the weirdness of being a father of two kids with very different ages, here at the Bay Area.</p>\n<h2>Personal Time Off</h2>\n<p>Taking time out of work is a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2I5cCUj\">polarizing topic</a> for Silicon Valley: Either you should at least be <a href=\"https://cnb.cx/2JZcnfW\">working 25 hours a day</a> to be a successful entrepreneur, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2CMNApu\">working while your competition sleeps</a>, and spending your weekends building side projects; or you should completely disconnect from Internet, never writing a single line of code outside of work hours.</p>\n<p>For a while, I was convinced that you could get a balanced schedule. A year ago, it wasn’t difficult to find time to code while also finding a moment to play video games with my older son, or taking my wife out for dinner.<br>\nThat changed when the new baby arrived.</p>\n<p>I’m very thankful of working at LinkedIn, where you get a lot of time for paternity leave; a benefit <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2FQtqNa\">unavailable to more than 30 million workers in the USA</a> and that people who do have it don’t tend to fully appreciate it.</p>\n<p>During my weeks off, I was horrified of going back to work and being so rusty that I would be left behind in my project. In between diaper changes, I felt the urge of writing code, or just looking at Stack to see what was happening back at the office.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/49286/baby.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Depicted: A baby with a computer, but not mine\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/c739e/baby.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/8ee9c/baby.jpg 148w,\n/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/ebbe7/baby.jpg 295w,\n/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/c739e/baby.jpg 590w,\n/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/5413e/baby.jpg 885w,\n/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/4efde/baby.jpg 1180w,\n/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/abfc3/baby.jpg 1770w,\n/static/beee3f84329f1fdaa707c561e3ac5d01/49286/baby.jpg 5472w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Thankfully, with my wife’s help (and a good dose of self-control and many, many nights without sleeping), I fully disconnected and used my time to take care of my family.<br>\nAnd while I wasn’t sure at the time, looking back not only I don’t regret that decision but I’m more convinced today that I shouldn’t have worried about work.</p>\n<p>One thing needs to be clear: As valuable as the time you spend coding is, you can always do it later. Feeding your newborn baby is something that, if it goes away, it will never come back.</p>\n<h2>New time schedule</h2>\n<p>After weeks of not knowing when I would be able to sleep through a whole night again (<em>spoiler alert: it only has happened a couple of times since</em>) the time I used to have for any personal activities got reduced to minutes in a week.</p>\n<p>The first thing to go was the time I dedicated to my weekend projects and blog writing. I chose things like playing a video game once in a while, or watching a movie over the <em>side hustle</em> for a very simple reason: Avoiding burnout.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4361d86fd70736f79724c12206de33ef/125ef/burnout.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Depicted: Burnout, but of a car.

In the 30’s people were questioning themselves <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2uBJD2u\">if radio was a good thing for “the modern child”</a>. Same thing happened to TV, and computers.</p>\n<p>Usually, we use two types of criteria to evaluate if something is right for our kids:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Was it good for me when I was a child?</li>\n<li>Do the experts say it’s good for my children?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, most of us didn’t have tablets and smartphones while growing up, so we rely on what the experts say. Even the people in Silicon Valley. And Silicon Valley is as confused about this as you are.</p>\n<p>I do understand and share some of their doubts: Every day they see the way big tech companies use data to influence people behavior, to shape what they believe and trust.</p>\n<p>But ultimately  it’s all about us fearing not being able to understand two things: Tech, and our own kids. We watch them watch other kids play video games and we are afraid they are not “having fun in the right way”.</p>\n<p>My older son has two iPads, one personal and one the school gave him for his homework. My baby now distinguishes <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2KHxi2i\">Netflix’s institutional opening</a> because it plays before his favorite cartoon which he can watch in demand.</p>\n<p>We could have chosen to try and shield them from the world we live today in an effort to protect their “innocence”, to have them play with things we know are safe (because we think they were safe for us).<br>\nBut it’s an uphill battle (that we would be surely losing) against a danger that mostly a shadow of our own insecurity of not being able to understand what young people do anymore.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fatherhood in Silicon Valley","date":"April 01, 2019","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019/4/fatherhood/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World"}},"next":null}}
